# atomico-diff

Is a small diff algorithm created to be used within web-components

## pragma h

```js
import {h,diff} from "atomico-diff";

let div = document.createELement("div");

diff(
   false,
   div,
   <host class="my-class">
)
```

## Use of branches of state

The diff process of Atomico, to avoid conflict between components, has a definition of state based on branches, defined by the father of the same component. with this it is sought to maintain independent between the state of the same component and the state of the component generated by the father.

The advantage of this is that it avoids the conflict of rewritten properties and elimination of events.
